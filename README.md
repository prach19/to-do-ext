# To Do List Extensions ☑️
This repo houses my work on a to do list extension, a project I have worked on for the last few years. 

 📁 **`to-do-ext`** directory includes files and documentation for the first/initial version of this extension. This was available ont he Chrome Store and Firefox store for 2 years until I updated it.
  
 📁 **`todoli`** directory includes files and documentation fo the most recent version of the extension. This is now available on the Chrome Store, get it [here](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/todoli/opnjmmadcljenkgggaaipfjpcnoilglk)!
