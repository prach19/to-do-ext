# THIS IS MY ARTIST STATEMENT - MY "WHY"
- as a person who relies on planning and organization, i wanted to make a functional extension that people like me could use with ease

- iâ€™m a person who is extremely dependent on planning and organization which means i make a lot of to do lists (and im obsessed with [notion](https://notion.so/product)). 

- i wanted to make an extension that anybody could use and was especially useful in the real world.

- i drew inspiration from popular extensions like [Focus To-Do](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/focus-to-do-pomodoro-time/ngceodoilcgpmkijopinlkmohnfifjfb?hl=en-US) and more


- in the future, i hope to develop this extension more to include a pomodoro timer or a confetti animation when the user crosses out a task
