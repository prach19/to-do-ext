This is a simple to do list browser extension that allows you to write and save tasks, check them off and delete them as you wish. When you check off a task, confetti plays to celebrate!

* Currently, the new version is under review and to be published on the Chrome Web Store soon. Until then, you can use the extension by downloading the [to-do-ext](/to-do-ext) folder and loading it into your browser by following [these](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) instructions.
* The old version is available on the Chrome Store [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/to-do-list/opnjmmadcljenkgggaaipfjpcnoilglk).
* The add-on is available [here](https://addons.mozilla.org/addon/minimal-to-do-list/) for Firefox.

## background (the how and why)
- as a person who relies on planning and organization, I wanted to make a functional extension that people like me could use with ease.
- before beginning this project, I created [test extensions](https://github.com/prach19/eecs1720/tree/main/chrome_ext_experiments)
- by creating test extensions I understood some basics of creating a browser extension such as the manifest.json, using the Chrome API, using popups, etc.
- in the future, I hope to develop this extension to include a pomodoro timer and more customization.
