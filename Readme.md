# THIS IS MY TECHNICAL README - MY "HOW"
- before beginning this project, i created [test extensions](https://github.com/prach19/eecs1720/tree/main/chrome_ext_experiments) with the help of [CodingTrain youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6bL9VOMT65ahNEri9uqLWfS)

- by creating test extensions i understood some basics of creating a browser extension such as the manifest.json, using the Chrome API, using popups, etc.

- once i figured out that i wanted to make a to-do list extension, i searched for resources and came across [another tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aw3G2jR-5IM&t=3978s) that was similar to what i had in mind. (this was used to give some direction)

- at the moment, the extension does the very basics: it allows you to create, cross off, and delete tasks easily
- **NOTE** : i am unsure if the extension works on firefox

- in the future, i hope to develop this extension more to include a pomodoro timer or a confetti animation when the user crosses out a task

- after creating a basic form of my extension, i worked on the aesthetics
- [STATEMENT.md](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/Prachi_Sadhwani/blob/main/Labs/lens-for-the-internet/Statement.md) provides more information on the "why" and artisitic content of this project
