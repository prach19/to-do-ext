This is a simple to do list broswer extension that allows you to write and save tasks, check them off and delete them as you wish. When you check off a task, confetti plays to celebrate!

At the moment, it is under review and to be published on the Chrome Web Store soon. Until then, you can use the extension by downloading the [to-do-ext](/to-do-ext) folder and loading it into your browser by following [these](https://webkul.com/blog/how-to-install-the-unpacked-extension-in-chrome/) instructions

# background (progress and how I made this)

- before beginning this project, I created [test extensions](https://github.com/prach19/eecs1720/tree/main/chrome_ext_experiments)

- by creating test extensions I understood some basics of creating a browser extension such as the manifest.json, using the Chrome API, using popups, etc.

- at the moment, the extension does the very basics: it allows you to create, cross off, and delete tasks easily
- **NOTE** : i am unsure if the extension works on firefox

- in the future, i hope to develop this extension more to include a pomodoro timer or a confetti animation when the user crosses out a task

- after creating a basic form of my extension, i worked on the aesthetics
- [STATEMENT.md](https://github.com/robots-make-art-too/Prachi_Sadhwani/blob/main/Labs/lens-for-the-internet/Statement.md) provides more information on the "why" and artisitic content of this project
