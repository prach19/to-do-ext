### Description
This is a to-do list Chrome extension which utilizes HTML, CSS, Javascript and localStorage. Users are able to create/add tasks, check them off the list and deleted them over time. 

### Why this project?
As someone who has a deep-rooted interest in productivity methods, time management and organizational skills, I wanted a minimalistic Chrome extension that allows me to focus on the tasks I have to complete rather than focusing on the appearance of the tasks (often a distraction for individuals).

### Future Ideas/Improvements
* This project aimed to create something with the **Create, Read, Update, Delete** system in mind. While it allows for each of these tasks to be carried out in some way, I would like to add a feature for editing the tasks so users can rectify their mistakes, if any.
* I would love to add a little pop-up or GIF congratulating/cheering the user on as a way of motivating them. However, I don't want this to be too distracting either.
